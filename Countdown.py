# Game based off of the British gameshow, Countdown. 
# With inspiration coming from the '8 out of 10 cats' variation.

# **** Rules ****

# **** Gameplay ****
# Two Letter Rounds, Two Numbers Rounds, One final Conundrum
# I believe it's L, N, L, N, C


# **** Numbers Round ****
# Choose 6 numbers to include a max of 4 large and a randomized target
# Large: 25, 50, 75 100
# Small: 1, 2, 3 ,4 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Target: Random between 100 and 1000 (my guess - actual rule?) 
# Any Contenstant / Team with the valid answer gets points (how many?)


# **** Letters Round ****
# Choose 9 letters to include at least 3 vowels and 4 consonents
# Possible combinations: 3v 6c, 4v 5c, 5v 4c
# Contenstant / Team with the longest word gets 1 point per letter
# Nine letters words are worth double points, or 18


# **** Conundrum Round ****
# 2 or 3 words with a total of 9 letters and a valid anagram
# Generally 10 points to the solving team, although variations exist
